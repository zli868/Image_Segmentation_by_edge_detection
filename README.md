The project investigated how can the image segementation be implemented not from the Neural network methods. Using edge detection techniques and flood fill in, we will have a comparable results.

The code is written in jupter-notebook.

New implementation is in canny.ipynb. While deep learning methods is in u-net-model-Code.ipynb.
